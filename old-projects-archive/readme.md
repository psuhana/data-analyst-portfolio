# 📚 Old Projects Archive

Hey!
This folder is a small archive of my earlier data projects — the experiments I built while learning Python, pandas, SQL basics, and exploratory analysis.

They aren't part of my main curated portfolio anymore, but they still show my learning process, curiosity, and how much I've grown in analytics and modelling over time.

---

## 🌱 What You'll Find Here
- Early EDA notebooks  
- Practice visualisations  
- Sports analytics comparisons  
- Small exploration notebooks (movies, wellness datasets, etc.)  
- Mini assignments and experimentation files  

These projects were super helpful when I was starting out, even if they're not as polished as my newer work.

## 🎯 Why Archive Them?
I wanted my main portfolio to highlight industry-ready, structured projects —  
**Fleet Predictive Maintenance**, **DSV Digital Twin**, and **Marketplace SQL Analytics**.

But I also didn’t want to delete my old work.  
So this folder keeps everything safe, tidy, and out of the way while still showing the full journey 🤍

It’s all part of the glow-up — from casual learning notebooks to full-blown modelling and analytics projects.
